The v2 channel map for the DUNE vertical drift coldbox test
is for runs 12065 and later.  It encodes two FEMB readout
cable swaps.

Note from Wenqiang and Roger:
The v4 channel map is meant to decode data with CRP4 & 5.
It is the same as CRP 2&3 but this time all the electronics
are "bottom drift" electronds.
